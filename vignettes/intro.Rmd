The new [magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/index.html) package is an ambitious effort to modernize and simplify high-quality image processing in R. It wraps the [ImageMagick STL](https://www.imagemagick.org/Magick++/STL.html) which is perhaps the most comprehensive open-source image processing library available today.

The ImageMagick library has an overwhelming amount of functionality. The current version of Magick exposes a decent chunk of it, but being a first release, documentation is still sparse. This post briefly introduces the most important concepts to get started.

## Installation

On Windows or OS-X the package is most easily installed via CRAN.

```r
install.packages("magick")
```

The binary CRAN packages work out of the box and have most important features enabled.
Use `magick_config` to see which features and formats are supported by your version of ImageMagick.


```{r}
str(magick::magick_config())
```


### Building from source

On Linux you need to install the ImageMagick++ library: on Debian/Ubuntu this is called [libmagick++-dev](https://packages.debian.org/testing/libmagick++-dev):

```
sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev
```

On Fedora or CentOS/RHEL we need [ImageMagick-c++-devel](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/ImageMagick-c++-devel):

```
sudo yum install ImageMagick-c++-devel
```

To install from source on OS-X you need `imagemagick` from homebrew.

```
brew install imagemagick --with-fontconfig --with-librsvg --with-fftw
```

The default imagemagick configuration on homebrew disables a bunch of features. It is recommended to brew with at least `--with-fontconfig` and `--with-librsvg` to support high quality font / svg rendering (the CRAN OSX binary package enables these as well).

## IO: Reading and writing

Images can be read directly from a file path, URL, or raw vector with image data with `image_read`. Similarly `image_write` exports images in an arbitrary format to a file on disk, or in memory if `path = NULL`.

```{r}
# Render svg to png
library(magick)
tiger <- image_read('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Ghostscript_Tiger.svg')
image_write(tiger, path = "tiger.png", format = "png")
```



IDE's with a built-in web browser (such as RStudio) automatically display magick images in the viewer. This results in a neat interactive image editing environment.

![RStudio Screenshot](https://ropensci.org/assets/blog-images/magick-rstudio.png)

Alternatively, on Linux you can use `image_display` to preview the image in an X11 window. Finally `image_browse` opens the image in your system's default application for a given type.

```r
# X11 only
image_display(tiger)

# System dependent
image_browse(tiger)
```

There is some functionality to convert images to R raster graphics and plot it on R's graphics display, but this doesn't always work too well yet.


```r
frink <- image_read("https://jeroenooms.github.io/images/frink.png")
raster <- as.raster(frink)
plot(raster)
```

Also the R graphics device is relatively slow for displaying bitmap images.

## Transformations and effects

The best way to get a sense of available transformations is walk through the examples in the `?transformations` help page in RStudio. Below a few examples to get a sense of what is possible.

```{r}
# Example image
frink <- image_read("https://jeroenooms.github.io/images/frink.png")

# Trim margins
image_trim(frink)

# Passport pica
image_crop(frink, "100x150+50")

# Resize
image_scale(frink, "200x") # width: 200px
image_scale(frink, "x200") # height: 200px

# Rotate or mirror
image_rotate(frink, 45)
image_flip(frink)
image_flop(frink)

# Set a background color
image_background(frink, "pink", flatten = TRUE)

# World-cup outfit (Flood fill)
image_fill(frink, "pink", "+100+200", 30000)
```

ImageMagick also has a bunch of standard effects that are worth checking out.

```{r}
# Add randomness
image_blur(frink, 10, 5)
image_noise(frink)

# Silly filters
image_charcoal(frink)
image_oilpaint(frink)
image_emboss(frink)
image_edge(frink)
image_negate(frink)
```

Finally it can be useful to print some text on top of images:

```{r}
# Add some text
image_annotate(frink, "I like R!", size = 50)

# Customize text
image_annotate(frink, "CONFIDENTIAL", size = 30, color = "red", boxcolor = "pink",
  degrees = 60, location = "+50+100")

# Only works if ImageMagick has fontconfig
image_annotate(frink, "The quick brown fox", font = 'times-new-roman', size = 30)
```

Maybe this is enough to get started.

## Layers and animation

The examples above concern single images. However all functions in magick have been vectorized to support working with layers, compositions or animation.

The standard base vector methods `[` `[[`, `$`, `c()` and `length()` are used to manipulate sets of images which can then be treated as layers or frames. This system is actually so extensive that we will do a separate blog post about it later.

For now here is an example on how to generate the instant classic dancing banana on R logo (which is probably why you are here):


```{r}
# Background image
logo <- image_read("https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png")
background <- image_scale(logo, "400")

# Foreground image
banana <- image_read(system.file("banana.gif", package = "magick"))
front <- image_scale(banana, "300")

# Combine and flatten frames
frames <- lapply(as.list(front), function(x) image_flatten(c(background, x)))

# Turn frames into animation
animation <- image_animate(image_join(frames))
print(animation)

# Save as GIF
image_write(animation, "Rlogo-banana.gif")
```
